IDEAS:
- Graphs
	- Hyperparameter tuning (Ensure parameters remain similar)
        Read Leslie Smith's paper on hyperparameter tuning
		Follow the same procedure for hyperparameter tuning
		-	Learning Rate 
		- 	Momentum 
		- 	Weight decay
		
		-	Number of encoder layers 
		-	Number of decoder layers 
		-	Number of heads 

What does it do well on
	- Confusion Matrix


1. Run their model
2. Get their results
3. Different Accuracy metrics, seeing where models go wrong
